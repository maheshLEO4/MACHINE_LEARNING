# Machine Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects built as part of my learning journey. It focuses on the **basic foundations** of machine learning, covering both **regression** and **classification** techniques. As I continue learning, I will keep updating this repository with more implementations and improvements.

---

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to:
- Practice and implement core ML algorithms from scratch or using basic libraries
- Build a strong foundation before moving to advanced topics
- Document and organize learning in a practical and reusable way

---

## Whatâ€™s Included

### Classification
Projects that involve predicting categorical outputs using supervised learning methods.

### Regression
Projects that involve predicting continuous outputs, including:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso)

Each project includes:
- Python code
- Clear and simple logic
- Example data for testing
